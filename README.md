# Mental-health-chatbot

## Overview

This project is a mental health chatbot designed to provide supportive responses and resources to users experiencing mental health issues. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand user input and provide appropriate responses. It is trained on a set of predefined intents and patterns to recognize and respond to various user queries.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts:

**Training Script**: Prepares the training data, trains the model, and saves the trained model.

**Chatbot GUI Script**: Loads the trained model and provides an interface for user interaction.
