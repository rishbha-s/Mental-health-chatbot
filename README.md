# Mental-health-chatbot

## Overview

This project is a mental health chatbot designed to provide supportive responses and resources to users experiencing mental health issues. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand user input and provide appropriate responses. It is trained on a set of predefined intents and patterns to recognize and respond to various user queries.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts:

**Training Script**: This script preprocesses the data, creates a bag-of-words model, and trains a neural network to classify user intents. It saves the processed data and trained model for later use.

**Chatbot GUI Script**: This script loads the trained model and data, and provides a graphical user interface for users to interact with the chatbot. It handles user input, predicts intents, and generates responses.

## Requirements:

Python 3.6+

TensorFlow
